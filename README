### About.
Fgamelaunch is an enhancement of Egamelaunch, by dracflamloc of 
DracSoft.com, including replays, watching, and more. My goal in
enhancing this is to provide a much easier-to-setup server than
dgamelaunch.

Egamelaunch started as a project by Emmanuel Jacyna, to get to know
the ncurses python library.
It is based heavily upon dgamelaunch, but is written in Python.

## Warning!! ##
This software is most likely filled with security holes!!
It is not to be used in production situations.


### Installation.
These instructions are for an SSH style connection only.
Basic familiarity with the administration of your system is assumed


1.Add a user (let's call it "egl") with no priveleges
2.Create a new directory "/var/games/egamelaunch"
3.Stick egamelaunch.py, egamelaunch.cfg and egl-banner in this directory.
4.Change the ownership of the directory (recursively) to egl 
5.Edit the egamelaunch.cfg file that should have come with this distribution
it is (I feel) fairly self explanatory. Also, you might want to change the 
egl-banner file to reflect your server.
6.Change egl's login shell to the path of egamelaunch.py 
(chsh -s /var/games/egamelaunch/egamelaunch.py egl)
7.Ensure you have ttyrec installed on the server. 
8.Test it by ssh'ing as egl

## Bugs ##
